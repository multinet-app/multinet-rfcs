This is the first official RFC in a new system proposed (through unofficial
channels, of course) by @AlmightyYakob (hereafter referred to as "Jake").

Jake mentioned his general difficulties in using Google docs to write and read
these proposals. Discussion is somewhat limited in Google docs, and he had a
constant desire to write plain text and use markup-style editing. Furthermore,
version control in Google docs is haphazard and implicit. GitHub does a better
job of tracking such changes, inviting people to have explicit discussions, and
generally preserving the history and provenance of documents such as this.

So, we are launching the initiative with a self-modeling RFC. In time, the
existing proposal documents will be transferred here so that a single,
transparent source of history for these proposals exists where all team members
can find it.
